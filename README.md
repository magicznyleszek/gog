# GOG

## Issues and notes

Issues:

- in the `.psd` mockup there was over 20 shades of gray used, I tried to bring this number down, but you are in need of a more precise color palette in your identity

Notes:

- the site is run on AngularJS with most content defined in `.json` data files
- I decided to use [Attribute Modules CSS technique](http://amcss.github.io/) for modules
