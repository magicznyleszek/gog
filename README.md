- form validation

## Issues and notes

Issues:

- in the `.psd` mockup there was over 15 shades of gray used, I tried to bring this number down (ended up with 9), but you are in need of a more precise color palette in your identity
- in the `.psd` mockup every text has `crisp` font-aliasing method, which renders far from the standard browser/os rendering (`Mac LCD` or `Mac` on OS X is far better choice) -- changing this helped a bit with tracinkg down "useless" grays

Notes:

- the site is run on AngularJS with most content defined in `.json` data files
- I decided to use [Attribute Modules CSS technique](http://amcss.github.io/) for modules
